# Bonekeep
A desktop application for DM/GMs to manage large soundscapes effortlessly during the game.

This is a work-in-progress project. It is by no means ready for usage in your game, though progress is being made weeky and an alpha version is coming soon. If you wish to follow this project, star or watch it.

### Intentions
Here are a few **goals** that I had in mind for this project:
- GMs can load/save *Acts*, which contain *Scenes*, which contain a set of sounds, which can be played automatically as part of the scene OR manually triggered (possibly with keybinds)
- transitions between scenes (when everything is working as intended, with keybinds)
- at a later stage, randomized sound patches (e.g. a scream three times in two minutes) - possibly useful for a little less monotonous soundscapes 

The current state of the project has some working parts (you can add scenes and sounds, as well as play, mute, loop them and set volume, getting the live feedback from the volume meter), BUT, it is just a prototype, has no saving yet and is not beautiful at all. 
I intend to develop this over time, but I am just one person. As said above, if you wish to possibly test future builds, *maybe consider giving the project a star to show me you are interested*.
